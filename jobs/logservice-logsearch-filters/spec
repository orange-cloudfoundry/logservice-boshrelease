  The job compiles Elasticsearch mappings and filters specific to logservicey.
  These mappings are add-ons to mappings and filters defined in Logsearch release.
  It also handle filters for platform when using syslog-release.
  It will parse CEF logs from https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/cc-uaa-logging.html.
  This can be considered as a drop in replacement logsearch-for-cloudfoundry release for filters and index mapping.
